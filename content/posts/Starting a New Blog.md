Today I am starting my Blog. I have been meaning to do this for some time.

I'd like to thank NetworkChuck for his inspiration for doing this.

In this blog I will go through many things that I have learnt during my journey as a Jim's IT tech and any hurdles that I may come across. Last year I had been doing a lot of installs for a few companies. The jobs involved were installing CleverLoggers and doing hot swap UPS battery replacements for Chemist Warehouse stores and changing over Kiosk screens for Hungry Jack's. Next moth will be a big month of replacing media players in Woolworths stores.
