      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today I am starting my Blog. I have been meaning to do this for some time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d like to thank NetworkChuck for his inspiration for doing this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this blog I will go through many things that I have learnt during my journey as a Jim&amp;rsquo;s IT tech and any hurdles that I may come across. Last year I had been doing a lot of installs for a few companies. The jobs involved were installing CleverLoggers and doing hot swap UPS battery replacements for Chemist Warehouse stores and changing over Kiosk screens for Hungry Jack&amp;rsquo;s. Next moth will be a big month of replacing media players in Woolworths stores.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;how-to-fix-windows-update-blue-screen&#34;&gt;HOW TO FIX WINDOWS UPDATE BLUE SCREEN&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today I came across a laptop that was stuck in and update blue screen, where no amount of restarting, or rebooting, you would come back to the same point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The way to fix this issue was actually quite simple and I will help you through the process.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
